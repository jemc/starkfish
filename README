= Starkfish

An aesthetically revised template for darkfish, the rdoc documentation generator for ruby.

== How do I get it?

gem install starkfish

== What's in it?

Within lib/rdoc/generator/template/, a new starkfish template is created 
alongside the darkfish template.  The template is essentially a copy of 
the darkfish template with the visual changes I wanted.  These changes are 
mostly concentrated within rdoc.css.
